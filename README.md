Learn how to use the Hapi (Node.js) web framework to build scalable apps in less time.

## What is Hapi?

Hapi is a framework for rapidly building RESTful web services. 
Whether you are building a very simple set of RESTful services 
or a large scale, cache heavy, and secure set of services, 
hapi has you covered. Hapi will help get your server developed 
quickly with its wide range of configurable options.

## Why Hapi instead of XYZ framework?

**Q**: I already know how to build REST APIs in [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
and [Restify](http://mcavage.me/node-restify/) why learn a new framework? <br />
**A**: 

### Key Benefits

- ***Performance*** - Walmart Labs are the guys who found/solved the 
[Node.js *CORE* Memory Leak](http://www.joyent.com/blog/walmart-node-js-memory-leak)
they have developed Hapi follwing [Benchmark Driven Development](https://github.com/felixge/faster-than-c)
and as a result they have built a high-performance framework.
- Security - they have focussed on security and battle-tested the framework
during [Black Friday](http://nodeup.com/fiftysix) without incident.
- Configuration Centric - 
- Plugin Architecture - easy to extend / add your own modules (good ecosystem)
- ***DevOps Friendly*** (great stats logging)
- Built-in Caching (Redis or Memcached)
- 100% Code Coverage (for the core)
- Key Functionality is **Built-in** 


Lets not forget that
